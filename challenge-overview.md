This is collaboration space and will become the starter files and work item list for the MSFT Azure Apps July 2019 Airlift content.

## Goal
Enable small teams of App-focused GBBs/CSAs/... to get hands on experience with the combination of Azure Policy, Azure DevOps, GitHub and AKS.

## Logistics
- Teams of 4-6 participants
- Floating proctors (not at the table)
- If you already know how to do it, you can advise your team but don't touch the keyboard
- It will be approximately a 3 hour time block
